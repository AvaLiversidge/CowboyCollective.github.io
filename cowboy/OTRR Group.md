The Old Time Radio Researchers Group is a community of enthusiastic fans, avid listeners, and strong supporters of “Old Time Radio". The group’s goals include restoring, preserving and sharing the classic shows from what is commonly known as the "Golden Age of Radio" (1930-1960). The OTRR Group, comprised of a diverse world wide group of volunteers, has undertaken many ongoing projects and continues to work hard to preserve our wonderful radio heritage. Similar to the Cowboy Collective, everyone is invited to volunteer, and there are many projects one can participate in.
