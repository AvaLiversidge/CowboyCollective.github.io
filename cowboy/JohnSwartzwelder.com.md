John Swartzwelder is a notoriously reclusive comedy writer and novelist who has written over fifty episodes of *The Simpsons*. Swartzwelder doesn't give interviews or make public appearances, and the few photos he does appear in are group photos. 

[JohnSwartzwelder.com](https://johnswartzwelder.com/) started as a fan page, but sometime around 2020 appears to have transitioned into something more official. However, it includes no clear method of contact (the [Privacy Policy page](https://johnswartzwelder.com/privacy-policy/), which is not linked to from the main site, ends with the statement "if you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us," but no link or email?) and when contact was established with the site owner, he signed his name with something other then "John" and requested to be credited only as "JohnSwartzwelder.com"

Mysterious.
