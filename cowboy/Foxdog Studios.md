We are IT consultants who accidentally started making live comedy shows with technology.

During our live shows, audiences join in via their phones - to play games, control robot chefs, fire sausage cannons, and make music.

As programmers, weâ€™re also experts at creating interactive exhibitions, software development and invoicing systems.
