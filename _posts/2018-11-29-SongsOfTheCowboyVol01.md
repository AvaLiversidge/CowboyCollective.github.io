You can download (and pay for if you like) the album over at [BandCamp](http://cowboycollective.bandcamp.com/album/songs-of-the-cowboy-vol-01), and the "Songs of the Cowboy" releases always come with a collection of "[Remix Stems](https://cowboycollective.bandcamp.com/album/songs-of-the-cowboy-vol-01-remix-stems)" to help make all kinds of cowboy art.

Happy Hunting!
