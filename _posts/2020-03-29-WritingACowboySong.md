Howdy!

Last week I played some cowboy songs out of my window to hopefully lift spirits in this difficult time. [Here is the link to that post](https://cowboycollective.cc/2020/03/23/EuropeFriends.html).

When I put the signs up I committed to doing something for three weeks, so this Monday I found myself wondering what I should do. I didn't want to just play the same songs again.

I decided I would try and compose an original cowboy song on the spot. I didn't prepare anything before hand, so this felt like a bit of a high-wire act.

I tried to explain what I was doing while I was doing it. This was very much an experiment, but I might be interested in trying this again sometime.

In addition to the version here, I released an unedited version. [That can be viewed here](https://youtu.be/-MHBurbzEDc).

We will see what happens next week!
