Yeehaw!

The Cowboy Collective has been approved for Spotify! [Songs of the Cowboy (Vol. 01)](https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/11/29/SongsOfTheCowboyVol01.html) is [streamable](spotify:album:42tgjsFqfKxmmthVL6h0CP) and our [official playlist](https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/12/06/SpotifyPlaylist.html) is that much more official!

This actually took a little doing, as the album got rejected the first time around. Spotify, in its infinite wisdom, assumed that because all the songs were exactly a minute long it must be a collection of "preview" tracks and not the full album.

To combated this, I threw on a track of me explaining the [$1000 reward situation](https://cowboycollective.cc/music) with six minutes of silence at the end. This seemed to do the trick. Hopefully we won't get sued by the estate of John Cage.<br><br>

The album is also available to stream on less Sweetish services like Apple Music if that floats your boat.
