Hey Y'all!

We're about ready to start seriously promoting the Cowboy Collective, and what better way to do that, then to stick up some [WANTED posters](https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/12/01/WANTEDPosters.html)?

I wanted to encourage everyone to find ways to make these posters their own, so I figured I'd do some handwritten posters, because hand writing is always kind of unique to the person doing it.

Cowboy [Guido De Boer](https://cowboycollective.cc/cowboy/Guido%20De%20Boer) has given me some instructions on making Cowboy Calligraphy, which he's assured me he'll share with the rest of us soon!

Regardless, here are some notes and pictures documenting my process.

First, I printed out some posters and got paper in the same size.

I then drew guide lines in pencil, copying the layout of the poster.

Then I added the text, following Guido's instructions on making cowboy letters. One of the features of this era of letter making is a playful experimentation with the traditional rules.

Finally, I scanned it into the computer so I could make some more print outs.

I wanted to experiment with making a really big poster, so I bought the biggest piece of paper I could afford, and followed the same process.

I really like how the letters in "WANTED" came out, and I think I'll experiment with them in the future!

The .zip file includes black and white copies of my handwritten WANTED posters, so you can help get the word out by printing some out and posting them around!<br><br>
