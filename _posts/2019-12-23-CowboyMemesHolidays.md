Happy Holidays Deputies and Rangers of all kinds.

Ah, it's that time of year again - the time to spread love and yuletide joy to everyone around you. And while you might be thinking, "Hey, I'd better send out my best Christams and Kwanza memes while the gettin's good!" I think it's important to take a step back now and then and look at what the holiday season is *really* about...I'm talking **Cowboys**!

I've assembled a small collection of some of my favorite cowboy memes for you to spread and share as you please. Not convinced these are the right memes for you this holiday season? Well just check out these festive examples:

*You can send this one to your cousin Joey after he steals the last piece of Christmas Ham after you called dibs*

*For when you propose to your girlfriend on the last night of Hanukkah - Mazeltov!*

Thats all folks! I wish you all a Happy Holidays, and a very merry yee to your haw.
