HANDS:( With gleaming swiss army knife hands, you reach to your belt.) 

shocking like an atom bomb, rocking like a carriage  

across the rocks and painted hills, a perfectly mannered marriage 

A MOUTH:( Sipping on expired Tang from an heirloom flask. Gold. )

puckered lips (n) -  two parallel sides of a canyon colliding on a single stick of dynamite,
said to keep their soft insides from turning into piles of ashes.

A TONGUE: ( To feed them)

jerky. 

no.

beans. 
							                    
HEELS:( Adorned with a rattler's fangs)

venom rips through red blood, forming whirling tide pools of toxicity that are:
1.) furious 2.) frantic 3.) and frigid...but a sheriff runs faster.

EYES:( You donâ€™t need to squint at night)

off the mirrored glass plains cut out by the desert sun the moon illuminates yellow pupils at the end of Long. Gun. Barrels.
