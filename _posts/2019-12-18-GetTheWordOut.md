**WANTED:**

You to help the Cowboy Collective get the word out!

The Cowboy Collective has a mission: to empower everyone to be a cowboy by providing resources and a safe space to make cowboy art, but we can't accomplish our mission if nobody knows that we exist. Help get the word out by making your own wanted posters, or other cowboy related art and materials, and plastering them around public spaces!

I've gone ahead and made some print outs of wanted posters, and I drew my own.

2. **[Here is a link to my post about drawing WANTED posters](https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/12/17/HandDrawnPosters.html).**

I hope you all with think of some fun and creative ways of spreading the message. Stickers? Origami cacti? [Recruiting an army of pigeons](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/pigeons-cowboy-hats-las-vegas.html)?
