Howdy!

I recently had the pleasure of working on a little music video with some of my fellow cowboys (which you can watch below) and I felt like it may be time to share the inner workings of that process with the collective since it was such a dog-gone good time.

Inside the zip folder I have included a number of files I used to create the final version found on youtube. This includes **sounds** such as foley and music by the very talented [Owen Earl](https://cowboycollective.cc/cowboy/Owen%20Earl), **video** starring Caleb Ross and a very dashing lamp, as well as the **photos** I used to create the opening stop motion as well as all of the titles.

Feel free to use these files as a resource to practice editing, greeen screen, or whatever your artistic heart desires. Enjoy!<br><br>
