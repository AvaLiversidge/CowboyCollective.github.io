The shy cowboy typeface is the result of experiments with the [Write cooker](https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/12/06/CowboyCalligraphy.html), mixing different script and models. The slightly reversed contrast and the grotesque look of some letters give it a cowboyish, westernish feeling. But far from the black bold ornamental letters that we usually associate with cowboys, the shy cowboy typeface is timid. His human alter ego would be a cowboy who puts foam under his boots so that they do not make too much noise, who whispers when he enters a bar and who hides his eyes under his big hat, always tight on his head.
