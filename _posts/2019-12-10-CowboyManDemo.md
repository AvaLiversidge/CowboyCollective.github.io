Exactly one year ago today I posted the following video on my snapchat story:

I have an ongoing project on my snapchat where I write little "odes" to people and things. These have included *ode to Madi's new Glasses* and *ode to Error 404 page not found*. They're one-minute songs that share something that's on my mind. Part of the joy of these songs is that they're ephemeral. We will never know what *ode to Crack in the Wall* sounded like. The moment has passed.

This ode started out in a similar fashion. I was playing around with the Lene Lovich song *One Lonely Heart* on the piano, and through reinterpretation and experimentation transformed it into this little ode to a kind-heated cowboy who wonders what his legacy will be.

It was a rough and fun idea celebrating something on my mind. I thought it would disappear.

The next day I was still thinking about it, though, and I decided I wanted to record a proper version.

I spent the next ten days writing and recording the songs in [*Songs of the Cowboy (Vol.1)*](https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/11/29/SongsOfTheCowboyVol01.html).

The rest, as they say, is history.

Earlier this week I was going through my saved snapchats and found *ode to Cowboy Man*. This is the only "ode" I've ever saved. I must have known something on a subconscious level that I wouldn't realize consciously for almost another year.

The demo is included in the [*Songs of the Cowboy (Vol. 1) - REMIX STEMS*](https://cowboycollective.bandcamp.com/album/songs-of-the-cowboy-vol-01-remix-stems) album.
