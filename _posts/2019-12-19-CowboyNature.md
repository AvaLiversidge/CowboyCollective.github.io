One of the most important relationships a cowboy holds is with their own mother nature. Yes indeed as a cowboy walks the land, there's a sense that they are themselves a part of it. As the wind makes the birds glide, the prairie dogs burrow, the cowboy plays a role all the same. It's a symbiotic affair, one that keeps you from being parched in a desert, and in turn keeps the crops fertilized. So as you sojourn in nature, keep in mind that it also sojourns through you, and keep in mind somewhere deep down there is no line drawn between nature and cowboy.
