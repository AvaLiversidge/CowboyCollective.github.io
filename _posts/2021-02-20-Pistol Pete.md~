Nobody is assigned cowboy at birth - anyone who reaches that height has worked and built to become the cowboy of their hearts. Men and boys, likewise all become who they are. But once they peak and triumph at being what the world demands of men and boys, they can relax a little. They can stop exhausting themselves. Colour can flourish. Shoulders can be relaxed. Men who strive to be manly must be exhausted, and may do themselves a disservice. We all reach where we're going, and then, more interestingly, strive to be *ourself*!
