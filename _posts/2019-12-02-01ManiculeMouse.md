If you've been using the site on desktop, you may have noticed our lovely Manicule Mouse. Here's a little info on what that is and how this effect is achieved.

1. **About Manicules**<br>
Manicules are the name given to the punctuation mark that looks like a finger pointing. The tradition of drawing little fingers pointing to things dates back to the 12th
century.  That's back when books were all written by hand. They've been phased in recant, people these days just use bullet points or arrows, but they were alive and well during the cowboy era!

2. **Making the Manicules**<br>
I wanted to give the site a little extra touch of cowboy and whimsy by turning the mouse cursor into a manicule when links are hovered over. Luckily there is a manicule in the [the WANTED Poster Resource Pack](https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/12/01/WANTEDPosters.html), which includes a set of actual historical WANTED posters. [This one right here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CowboyCollective/Wanted-Posters/master/Refrences/John%20Wilkes%20Booth.jpg) has the manicule in question.
