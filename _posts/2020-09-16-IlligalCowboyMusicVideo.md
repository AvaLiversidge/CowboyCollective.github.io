A blend of original and found footage telling the story of an aspiring cowboy in West Yorkshire, England. After consuming a psychoactive frog, he has a terrifying vision of a manufactured cowboy reality stripped of all freedom culminating in imprisonment. By contrasting the ideal of cowboyism against both popular imagination and the restrictions of contemporary society, we are asking whether an authentic cowboy lifestyle is possible in the 21st century. By showing a man at odds with their own idealised version of themselves we are inviting the viewer to question whether the masculine construction provided by society is truly "freeing".
