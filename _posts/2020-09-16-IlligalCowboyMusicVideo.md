This music video tells the story of an aspiring Cowboy's battle with reality and idealism. The music video is made from footage filmed by seven amateur videographers around the UK (and one royalty free clip of a horse) and was edited live on Twitch. The video tells the story of an aspiring Cowboy in West Yorkshire, grappling with his desires and reality after the consumption of a psychoactive frog. By showing a man at odds with his own dreams, we invite the viewer to question whether the freedoms represented by the cowboy lifestyle are possible in the 21st century. You can watch the editing process [here](https://youtu.be/c9ASTVmBbaA).
