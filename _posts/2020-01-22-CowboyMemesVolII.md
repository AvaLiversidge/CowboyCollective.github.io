Oh Hi Howdy!

About a month ago [Colbe Schicatano](https://cowboycollective.cc/cowboy/Colbe%20Schicatano) made a post of some cowboy memes. It was a good start, but definitely not definitive! That's why I'm submitting my own collection of cowboy memes. You can see my additions in the gallery.

Here are a couple examples:

**Why There Were Problems in the Wild West**
