Howdy!

This was the final day of my "Cowboy Music for my European Friends" series.

I wanted to go with something simple and fun because last week was a little on the exhausting side of things. I decided to play the *Searchlight Rag* by Scott Joplin.

Ragtime is defensively a quintessential cowboy genre, and Scott Joplin is often considered the King of ragtime. I'm sure he'll continue to make appearances here at the Cowboy Collective. This is one of my favorite and lesser known Joplin pieces.

As always, I am more of a composer than performer, so my rendition of this cowboy classic is less than perfect.
