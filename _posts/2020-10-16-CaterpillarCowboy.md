Created in 72 hours as part of the [Ludum Dare Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/). A game jam involves developers/artists/musicians working alone or collaborating to create a game under a theme in a short amount of time. The theme of this event was "Stuck in a loop", so we made made a game where your wrap your caterpillar body around all the critters that have gotten loose at the ranch, and watch out for the law.
