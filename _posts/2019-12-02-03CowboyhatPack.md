Oh Hi Howdy!

I was watching this music video from the Taylor Swift song *You Need to Calm Down.* The song is a real banger, and I love the messaging in it, but something occurred to me... There's hardly a cowboy in it!

<iframe id="youtube" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dkk9gvTmCXY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>

In fact, there's only one cowboy I could spot in the entire music video and he's tucked away in the corner. SAD!!

The song is all about representation, but I feel the cowboys are a little underrepresented here...

Now THAT'S more like it!

You know, Taylor Swift started out as a country artist, and the way the cowboys are represented in this video makes me feel like she's ashamed of her cowboy past. THIS IS SO SAD!! Being a cowboy is nothing to be ashamed of Taylor! Cowboys can be lovers too!!<br><br>

*We all have crowns? More like we all have COWBOY HATS!*<br><br>

*A movement I can really get behind!*<br><br>

Anyway, I'm releasing a [**Pre-Photoshopped Cowboy Hat Pack.**](https://codeload.github.com/CowboyCollective/CowboyHat-Pack/zip/master) That way if you're out and about on the internet and you feel the way the cowboys are being represented is a little lacking, you can just pop one of these bad boys on there, and *blamo!* Cowboy representation!

Help spread our message of cowboy love and inclusivity by inserting these Pre-Photoshopped Cowboy Hats everywhere!

I want the number of cowboy hats in this zip file to get to a million, so you can also help the cause by making and contributing some Pre-Photoshopped Cowboy Hat images!

Love to see what y'all do with this!<br><br>
