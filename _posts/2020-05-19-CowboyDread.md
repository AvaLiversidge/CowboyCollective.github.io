I interpreted this song to be the story of a dead cowboy, haunted by his conscience and the traumas of the past, to pursue therapy in the afterlife. The music video follows this narrative.

The video offers a novel and goofy take on how a cowboy handles the built up trauma of a lifetime. The cowboy remains unimpassioned throughout, still close hearted from his former life, facing the beginning of his own growth. To me, this signifies how the path towards self improvement often doesn't start through manic optimism, but instead through reluctant surrender.
