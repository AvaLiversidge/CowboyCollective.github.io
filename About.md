The Cowboy Collective is a free-range group of artists making creative commons cowboy themed art!

We are looking to empower everyone to be a cowboy by offering resources and an inclusive space to make and share cowboy art! You can learn more about our mission by reading the [manifesto](https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/11/28/Manifesto.html).

We are offering a $1000 REWARD for making a music video to one of the songs in ["Songs of the Cowboy"](https://cowboycollective.bandcamp.com/album/songs-of-the-cowboy-vol-01). Head over to [CowboyCollective.cc/music](https://CowboyCollective.cc/music) to learn more.
