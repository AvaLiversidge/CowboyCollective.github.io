The Cowboy Collective is a free-range group of artists making [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) cowboy-themed art!

We are looking to empower everyone to be a cowboy by offering resources and an inclusive space to make and share cowboy art! You can learn more about our mission by reading the [manifesto](https://cowboycollective.cc/2019/11/28/Manifesto.html).

We are offering a $1000 REWARD for making a music video to one of the songs in *[Songs of the Cowboy](https://CowboyCollective.cc/2019/11/29/SongsOfTheCowboyVol01.html)*. Head over to [CowboyCollective.cc/music](https://CowboyCollective.cc/music) to learn more.

Everything that is here on the site is [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode), which means you are free to download and remix make your own! Just make sure to give us a little shout-out when you do!

<h1 id="CCCCC">How do I become a Cowboy Collective Card Carrying Cowboy?</h1>

We have a saying around these parts which is "anyone can be a cowboy," and we **mean** it! Everything here was made by people like you, and submitting work to be included in the archives is easy!

When you submit work, you will automatically be given a place over in our [Cowboys](https://cowboycollective.cc/Cowboys) page as a Cowboy Collective Card Carrying Cowboy! Work can be as simple as a poem you wrote or as complex as a video game, and nothing is too weird or too normal!

If you can't contribute art, you can also contribute money. Doing so will also get you a place on the [Cowboy Collective Card Carrying Cowboy](https://cowboycollective.cc/Cowboys) section, and all money contributed will go towards making more cowboy art!

Mosey on over to the [contribute](https://cowboycollective.cc/Submit) section to learn more!
